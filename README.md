# Music Job Watcher

This project watches selected education and assessment companies for job postings
that mention **"Music"** in the title or description. It currently supports
companies hosted on **Greenhouse** and **Lever** job boards.

Results are stored in:
- `music_jobs.csv` â†’ CSV log of all matching jobs
- `seen_music.json` â†’ deduplication store so the same posting isnâ€™t added twice

The workflow is configured to run on GitHub Actions twice per day, but you can
also run it locally.
